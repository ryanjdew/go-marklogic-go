This folder contains UTCP manuals used by the Code Mode MCP bridge.

Manuals in this folder (examples):
- `marklogic-manual.json` — sample HTTP-based MarkLogic calls.
- `go-manual.json` — sample CLI-based Go developer tools for build, test, lint, and run.

Note: to use CLI-based tools, code-mode MCP bridge must have the CLI plugin enabled (registerCli()). Use CLI tools only in trusted local development environments.
